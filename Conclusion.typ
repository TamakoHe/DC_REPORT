In the course of dynamic and control, we learnt a lot about how to 
analyze and design a dynamic system based on examples on typical dynamic systems.

In the lab sessions, I analyzed some systems with MATLAB based on 
mathematical principles such as z ans s transform and differential 
equations.  Analysis of a dynamic system is the process that convert the physical model into the mathematical model. With computer and mathematical algorithms, these system can be analyzed and simulated
making them easier to be designed and optimized.
