= Introduction
Dynamic and control is the course that focuses on analyzing and designing dynamic system. A dynamic system is one which is in motion.
Electronic circuits, motors and even airplanes are dynamic systems. 
These lab sessions take some typical dynamic systems that we have learnt on the lectures, aiming to improve our abilities to analyze and implement theses dynamic systems.
